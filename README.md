Coach recently acquired a down-market brand and hopes to better understand how these customersâ€™ lifetime values compare with their up-market customers and how to optimize their offerings to target the down-market customers. I used a pseudo-churn model to analyze the dataset for customer satisfaction to calculate customer lifetime value (CLV) and compare down market to up market customers. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. DMCs have a lower average CLV than UMCs
2. Highest popularity products tend to be purchased by customers with lower CLVs compared to middle popularity products
3. Focusing on maximizing the high CLV customers in the middle popular products
4. Promote more niche items that loyal customers are buying (middle products with high CLV)

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
For optimal strategy,
1. Segment between high and low CLV for middle selling products
- Promote more niche items to more loyal customers (high CLV)
- High CLV more likely to purchase
2. Target both high and low CLV for best selling products
- Promote popular items to a greater range of customers
- More people are more likely to purchase popular products
- Could even attract new customers
